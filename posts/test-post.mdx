Hello all, to my first Blog Post! Today my first Blog Post is regarding my recent contributions to the vscode-pets extension.
I love this extension as it gives the functionality to show pets in your browser, as well as interacting with them.
As I have some experience developing vscode extensions I saw an opportunity to help contribute to this extension.
After extensive use of the extension, I noticed that the reset pets command was not working and spurred on by a recent issue
regarding an [issue](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets/issues/96) of the same category. I became enthralled to contribute
and fix this issue.

First I overridden my recent change of creating a status bar to help create a pet easier, in order to add the functionality of
a pet playground being created on the use of the command. I did this with a Status Bar Object which I updated to specific commands
and its tooltip was changed. The code is below.

I created two status bar items with help of the vscode API

```
let petPlaygroundStatusBar : vscode.StatusBarItem;
let spawnPetStatusBar : vscode.StatusBarItem;
```

Then I assigned different commands to the status bar and updated them regularly

```
petPlaygroundStatusBar = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, 100);
petPlaygroundStatusBar.command = 'vscode-pets.start';
context.subscriptions.push(petPlaygroundStatusBar);

spawnPetStatusBar = vscode.window.createStatusBarItem(vscode.StatusBarAlignment.Right, 100);
spawnPetStatusBar.command = 'vscode-pets.spawn-pet';
context.subscriptions.push(spawnPetStatusBar);
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor(updateStatusBar));
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.onDidChangeTextEditorSelection(updateStatusBar));
context.subscriptions.push(vscode.window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor(updateExtensionPositionContext));
```

Then I displayed text on the Status Bar with help from [Anthony Shaw](https://github.com/tonybaloney/), whom found a squirrel image for the Tooltip
within the vscode API.

```
function updateStatusBar(): void {
    petsStatusBar.text = `$(squirrel)`;
	petsStatusBar.tooltip = "Create Pet Playground";
	petsStatusBar.show();
	spawnPetStatusBar.text = `$(squirrel)`;
	spawnPetStatusBar.tooltip = "Spawn Pet";
	spawnPetStatusBar.show();
}
```

For the Final Issue I tackled within the Pull Request, I chose to fix the broken reset-pets command and this was quite a challenge.
For some reason the webview was not receiving the post and after countless hours of debugging chose to remove everything associated
with the command and rewrite the webview post message.

I created two webview posts that equate to the following

```
public resetPets() {
    this.updatePetColor(this.petColor());
    this.updatePetType(this.petType());
    this.updatePetSize(this.petSize());
    this.update();
    this.getWebview().postMessage({ command: 'reset-pet' });
}

public removePet(spec: PetSpecification): void {
    this.getWebview().postMessage({
        command: 'remove-pet',
        spec,
    });
}
```

The webview received this post and that meant I could continue with the Pull Request.
I amended the switch statement to loop through every pet and remove everything associated
with that specific pet.

```
case 'reset-pet':
    allPets.pets().forEach((pet) => {
        pet.el.remove();
        pet.collision.remove();
    });
    allPets.reset();
    allPets.push(
        addPetToPanel(
            petType,
            basePetUri,
            petColor,
            petSize,
            randomStartPosition(),
            floor,
            floor,
            undefined,
        ),
    );
    petCounter = 1;
    saveState();
    break;
```

This code fixed the Issue but alas another issue arose. Whenever you used the reset pet command, the new pet state
was not saved meaning that the reset-pet command was rendered useless when you reset the editor.
This issue was very difficult to implement compared to the easier fix of the reset-pet command.

I combatted this issue by when creating a new PetPanel, it fetches pets from saved memory and incorporates them into the scene.

```
const spec = PetSpecification.fromConfiguration();
PetPanel.createOrShow(
    context.extensionUri,
    context.extensionPath,
    spec.color,
    spec.type,
    spec.size,
    getConfiguredTheme(),
    getConfiguredThemeKind(),
);
if (PetPanel.currentPanel) {
    var collection = PetSpecification.collectionFromMemento(
        context,
        getConfiguredSize(),
    );
    collection.forEach((item) => {
        PetPanel.currentPanel!.spawnPet(item);
    });
```

And then pushing the empty pet array when using the reset-pet command.

```
collection.push(spec);
storeCollectionAsMemento(context, collection);
```

And for the last of the code fetching the pets from memory when running the vscode-pets.spawn-pet command.

```
{
    webviewViewProvider.resetPets();
    var collection = PetSpecification.collectionFromMemento(
        context,
        getConfiguredSize(),
    );
    collection.splice(0, collection.length);
    storeCollectionAsMemento(context, collection);
} else if (PetPanel.currentPanel) {
    PetPanel.currentPanel.resetPets();
    var collection = PetSpecification.collectionFromMemento(
        context,
        getConfiguredSize(),
    );
    collection.splice(0, collection.length);
    storeCollectionAsMemento(context, collection);
}
```

With the last of this latter code, the issue was fixed.
I submitted a Pull Request which you can check out [here](https://github.com/tonybaloney/vscode-pets/pull/93)
and this code was merged and if you install the latest version of vscode-pets. Version 1.10.0, you will see
these changed incorporated into the extension!

Thank you for reading my first blog post expect many more to come!

Thank you for reading

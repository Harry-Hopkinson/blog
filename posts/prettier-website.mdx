description: "My First Contribution for Prettier"

Hello to all, sorry as this is a while after my first blog post but I have been busy regarding school.
I am here to inform to you about my first contribution to the Prettier code formatter. I have been interested
in Prettier for a while and a regular user as it is an essential tool for my workflow. For my first PR I noticed
that the website showed the State of JS from the 2020 survery, but not the recent 2021 survey.
In my PR I set out to incorporate the newest information for the website.

First of all I replaced the old State of JS 2020 image with the new 2021 image.

After replacing the images, I just updated the results to fit the new standard.

[State of JS 2020 Image](https://www.google.com/search?q=state+of+js+2020&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB1006GB1006&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7js_Alo_4AhXBS0EAHdUWB5wQ_AUIzwooAQ&biw=1920&bih=937&dpr=1#imgrc=9B1dXSgiRwHHYM)
[State of JS 2021 Image](https://www.google.com/search?q=state+of+js+2021&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB1006GB1006&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7js_Alo_4AhXBS0EAHdUWB5wQ_AUIzwooAQ&biw=1920&bih=937&dpr=1#imgrc=5VIEQ0CHp-wHeM)

```javascript
<p>Prettier is regularly used by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/#utilities">
            More than <strong>83%</strong> of respondents to State of
            JS 2021 (10282 developers out of 12360).
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/#utilities">
                More than <strong>70%</strong> of respondents to State of
                JS 2020 (14880 developers out of 20974).
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
```

This replaced the earlier...

```javascript
<div className="prose">
    Prettier is regularly used by more than <strong>70%</strong>
    &nbsp;of the respondents to the “Utilities” section of
    the&nbsp;
    <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/utilities">
        State&nbsp;of&nbsp;JS&nbsp;2020
    </a>{" "}
    survey (14880&nbsp;developers out of 20974).
</div>
<a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com">
    <img
        title="State of JS 2020"
        src="/images/state_of_js.svg"
        width="180"
        style={{ background: "#222429", borderRadius: 5 }}
    />
</a>
```
